# Cyber-Beginner-Resources
Often times I am asked by people starting out in cyber security "What should I learn if I do not have a technical background?" In my opinion, you should take time to learn the basics in many different computing fields before diving into cyber security. Cyber security takes concepts from these different fields, combines them, and adds on top of them. For a cyber security professional to hack or defend a piece of technology, they first need to understand how it works. Newcomers to cyber security may not know what computing topics to learn the basics of. To help with this, I have included a list of topics and courses below.

You may be asking why I only included links to courses here instead of including links to books, websites, etc. This document was meant to help someone who has identified their learning style to be most aligned with an online course. Everyone learns in a different way and some much prefer to be shown the basics of a topic and explore from there. I am one of these people. Also, you may be asking why most of the resources I include are paid instead of free. It has been my experience that paid courses are usually more comprehensive and more up-to-date than free courses. This is obviously not always the case, but it has been my experience. Also, most of the courses below can be purchased for around $10. If you're looking to purchase a Udemy course and it is not heavily discounted, I would recommend you wait. Udemy is constantly have sales where they discount their courses at around 90% off. 

Finally, it is important to note that I organized the list in alphabetical order, not in order of importance. Because there are a lot of resources listed below, I have also included a Getting Started Roadmap. This roadmap will be most helpful to those who have absolutely no technical background. I encourage those beginners to follow the roadmap and then explore from there. After completing the roadmap, you will identify what topics are interesting to you and what topics you find a complete snore.
