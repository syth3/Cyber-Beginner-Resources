# Ethical Hacking
Ethical Hacking seems to be the area of cyber security that everyone is interested in. What people may not realize is that in order to be able to hack something, you have to know how it works. This is similar to if you wanted to break into a house, you would first have to know how windows latches, door handles, and garage doors worked. It would be silly to try and break into a house if you couldn't open a door. Because of this, I recommend people work their way through the [Getting Started Roadmap](https://github.com/syth3/Cyber-Beginner-Resources/blob/main/Courses.md#geting-started-roadmap) section of the [Courses](https://github.com/syth3/Cyber-Beginner-Resources/blob/main/Courses.md) document and the [Homelab](https://github.com/syth3/Cyber-Beginner-Resources/blob/main/Homelab.md) document before diving into learning ethical hacking. This will give you the necessary foundation to start learning hacking concepts. With that said, below are the best resources I have found to learn ethical hacking concepts from.

## Certifications
Certifications in the ethical hacking realm are a big topic but I will sum it up like this: don't look at certifications like a golden ticket into an ethical hacking job. Certifications are a great place to start learning as they provide structured content and some way for others to verify you went through the content. With that said, don't learn something just for the test! Set your focus on learning the material for the sake of learning the material instead of learning it for the test. In interviews, technical interviewers will ask you questions regarding the certification and what you have learned. They will not simply take your certification at face value. Also, when possible, prioritize certification which have tests that are hands-on. The certifications that have written tests are great for getting started, but don't stop there! :)
